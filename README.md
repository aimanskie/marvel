# Marvel IOS App

![](https://github.com/aimanskie/marvel/blob/main/marvel%20mobile.gif)

## This is a React Native app and was developed using the IOS Simulator with the Expo Framework. Node js as the server and Mongo database

#

## npm install client and server

## touch .env file and add

#

# DATABASE='Your Mongodb Url', JWT_SECRET='anylongstring'

## npm start both client and server

## open in ios or android (if android you must do extra configuration based on expo)

## in open ios, scan the qr code and open up the app. However it will also open up the IOS Simulator which is better as we are connecting with server port 8000
